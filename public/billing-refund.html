    <h1>Billing &amp; Refund Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Billing &amp; Refund Policy explains how TalkUSA.NET ("TalkUSA",
      "we", "us") handles pricing, charges, payments, and refunds for the
      Services. This Policy forms part of our
      <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Billing Model</h2>
    <p>
      TalkUSA primarily operates on a prepaid model. You fund your account in
      advance, and charges for usage (such as outbound and inbound call
      minutes) and recurring services (such as monthly numbers and features)
      are deducted from your available balance.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Pricing</h2>
    <p>
      Current rates for our core services, including per‑minute charges and
      monthly recurring fees for numbers, are published on our
      <a href="/">website</a> or within your customer portal. Pricing may be
      updated from time to time. We will provide notice of material pricing
      changes in accordance with our Terms of Service.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Payments</h2>
    <p>
      You may add funds to your account using one or more supported payment
      methods (such as credit/debit cards, bank transfer, or approved
      third‑party payment providers). By submitting a payment method, you
      authorize us and our payment processors to charge that method for all
      amounts due, including taxes and applicable regulatory fees.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for providing accurate billing information and for
      keeping your payment details up to date. If a payment is declined or
      reversed, we may suspend or limit your access to the Services until the
      outstanding balance is resolved.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Invoices &amp; Statements</h2>
    <p>
      For each successful top‑up or manual credit, we provide a receipt via the
      email address associated with your account and/or through the customer
      portal. You may also view recent transactions and charges in the Billing
      section of the portal.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Taxes &amp; Regulatory Fees</h2>
    <p>
      Depending on your location and the nature of the Services, we may be
      required to collect taxes (such as sales tax, VAT, or similar levies) and
      regulatory fees. These amounts will be added to your invoices or
      deductions as required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Because our Services are usage‑based and often provision real‑time
      telecommunications resources, funds added to your TalkUSA account are
      generally <strong>non‑refundable</strong>. However, we may consider
      issuing a credit or refund in the following limited circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A duplicate or erroneous charge caused by a system error on our side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Proven unauthorized use of your account despite your adherence to
        reasonable security practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        A clear billing discrepancy where call records or invoices show that we
        billed incorrectly.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Any refund is at our sole discretion and may be issued as an account
      credit rather than a cash refund. We do not provide refunds for
      previously consumed minutes, completed calls, or expired balances unless
      required by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disputed Charges</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe a charge is incorrect, you must notify us in writing at
      <a href="mailto:billing@talkusa.net">billing@talkusa.net</a> within
      thirty (30) days of the charge date. Your notice should include relevant
      details such as invoice numbers, dates, amounts, and any supporting
      evidence. We will investigate the dispute and notify you of the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Failure to dispute a charge within this period may result in our
      inability to issue a credit or adjustment.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Chargebacks</h2>
    <p>
      Initiating a chargeback with your bank or card issuer without first
      attempting to resolve the issue with us may be considered a violation of
      this Policy. We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account if
      a chargeback is filed, and you will remain responsible for any
      outstanding balances and fees associated with the dispute.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Account Suspension for Non‑Payment</h2>
    <p>
      If your balance becomes negative or you fail to pay amounts due, we may
      suspend your ability to place or receive calls, provision new services,
      or access certain features. We will typically provide notice before
      suspension where practicable, but we may act immediately in cases of
      significant non‑payment or fraud.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Cancellation &amp; Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may cancel your account at any time by contacting our support team.
      Upon cancellation or termination, we may immediately disable access to
      the Services and release any associated telephone numbers in accordance
      with carrier and regulatory requirements. Except where required by law,
      unused prepaid balances are not automatically refunded upon cancellation.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Billing &amp; Refund Policy from time to time. When we
      make material changes, we will post the updated Policy on this page and
      update the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Services after
      the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>
