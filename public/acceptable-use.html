    <h1>Acceptable Use Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Acceptable Use Policy ("AUP") describes prohibited and restricted
      uses of the TalkUSA.NET communications network and Services. By using our
      Services, you agree to comply with this AUP in addition to our
      <a href="/terms.html">Terms of Service</a>. If you violate this AUP, we
      may suspend or terminate your access to the Services.
    </p>

    <h2>1. General Principles</h2>
    <p>
      The Services must be used responsibly and in compliance with all
      applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards. You are responsible
      for all activity occurring under your account, including activity by your
      employees, contractors, agents, and end users.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Prohibited Activities</h2>
    <p>You may <strong>not</strong> use the Services to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Send unsolicited bulk or commercial communications (spam) without
        appropriate consent, including SMS or voice broadcast campaigns that do
        not comply with applicable laws (such as the TCPA, CAN-SPAM Act, and
        Do-Not-Call rules).
      </li>
      <li>
        Engage in phishing, spoofing, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other
        deceptive or abusive behavior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place harassing, threatening, or abusive calls or messages, including
        robocalls or prerecorded messages without consent where required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Conduct or promote illegal activities, including but not limited to
        money laundering, illegal gambling, sale of controlled substances,
        distribution of malware, or infringement of intellectual property
        rights.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any network, system, or account
        (e.g., hacking, password cracking, or vulnerability scanning).
      </li>
      <li>
        Interfere with the normal operation of the Services or any network,
        including through denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, excessive traffic,
        or attempts to overload systems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Circumvent or attempt to circumvent call‑routing, usage, or billing
        mechanisms, including toll‑bypass or fraudulent traffic pumping.
      </li>
      <li>
        Violate the acceptable use policies or rules of our underlying
        carriers, data centers, or other service providers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Call Recording & Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the Services to record or monitor calls, you are solely
      responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations,
      including notice and consent requirements in each relevant jurisdiction.
      You must obtain all necessary permissions from participants before
      recording, monitoring, or transcribing calls.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Security & Abuse Prevention</h2>
    <p>You must take reasonable steps to protect your systems and access to the Services, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using strong, unique passwords and enabling security features where available.</li>
      <li>Restricting access to your PBX, SIP endpoints, and admin interfaces.</li>
      <li>Monitoring usage for unusual or unexpected activity that may indicate fraud.</li>
      <li>Promptly notifying TalkUSA of any suspected security incident or unauthorized use.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Traffic Quality & Reasonable Use</h2>
    <p>
      We monitor network performance and traffic patterns to protect the
      integrity of our Services. We may take action, including rate limiting or
      temporary suspension, if your traffic:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creates excessive congestion or degrades service for other users.</li>
      <li>Generates abnormal or high‑risk call patterns (e.g., short‑duration loops, failed call floods).</li>
      <li>Appears to be associated with fraudulent or abusive behavior.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Lawful Use & Regulatory Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      You are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws and
      regulations that apply to your use of the Services, including but not
      limited to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Telecommunications and VoIP regulations in each country where you operate.</li>
      <li>Consumer protection, telemarketing, and Do‑Not‑Call rules.</li>
      <li>Privacy and data protection laws governing the collection and use of personal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Enforcement</h2>
    <p>
      If we determine, in our reasonable judgment, that you have violated this
      AUP, we may take any action we deem appropriate, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Issuing a warning or requesting that you modify your behavior.</li>
      <li>Suspending or rate‑limiting specific services, numbers, or routes.</li>
      <li>Blocking or filtering certain traffic or destinations.</li>
      <li>Terminating your account in accordance with our Terms of Service.</li>
      <li>Cooperating with law enforcement or regulators where required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Reporting Violations</h2>
    <p>
      If you believe that someone is using the Services in violation of this
      AUP, please contact us at
      <a href="mailto:abuse@talkusa.net">abuse@talkusa.net</a> with detailed
      information, including relevant call logs, timestamps, caller IDs, and
      any supporting evidence.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Acceptable Use Policy from time to time. When we make
      material changes, we will post the updated policy on this page and update
      the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Services after the
      effective date constitutes your acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>

      does not constitute legal advice. Please consult your legal counsel to
