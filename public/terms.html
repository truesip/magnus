    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="meta">Last updated: December 10, 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the
      TalkUSA.NET website, customer portal, APIs, and all related products and
      services (collectively, the "Services"). By creating an account, using the
      Services, or accessing our websites, you agree to be bound by these
      Terms. If you are entering into these Terms on behalf of an organization,
      you represent that you have authority to bind that organization.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility & Account Registration</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter
      into contracts to use the Services. When you create an account, you agree
      to provide accurate, current, and complete information and to keep it
      updated. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your
      login credentials and for all activities that occur under your account.
      You must notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access or
      misuse of your account.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Services</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are provided solely for lawful business communications. You
      agree to use the Services in compliance with these Terms, our
      <a href="/acceptable-use.html">Acceptable Use Policy</a>, and all
      applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to FCC rules,
      state and federal telecommunications laws, and telemarketing and privacy
      regulations (such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) and any
      Do-Not-Call (DNC) rules).
    </p>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Use the Services to transmit spam, unsolicited marketing messages, or
        bulk communications without proper consent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Engage in fraud, phishing, spoofing, phishing, impersonation, or other
        deceptive or unlawful activities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the Services in a manner that interferes with, disrupts, or
        degrades the integrity or performance of our networks or third-party
        networks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Attempt to probe, scan, or test the vulnerability of any system or
        network without proper authorization.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Service Availability & Modifications</h2>
    <p>
      We use commercially reasonable efforts to provide reliable, high-quality
      voice services. However, the Services may be subject to limitations,
      delays, and other problems inherent in the use of public networks,
      internet connectivity, and telecommunications infrastructure. We do not
      guarantee that the Services will be uninterrupted, error-free, or
      available at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any
      time, including to comply with legal or regulatory requirements, to
      maintain network integrity, or to address security issues. When
      reasonably possible, we will provide advance notice of material changes.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Billing, Fees & Taxes</h2>
    <p>
      TalkUSA operates primarily on a prepaid basis. You agree to pay all fees
      and charges associated with your account, including usage-based fees,
      subscription fees for numbers and services, taxes, and any applicable
      regulatory fees. Current pricing is published on our
      <a href="/">website</a> or in your customer portal and may be updated
      from time to time in accordance with these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated in a separate written agreement, all payments are
      due immediately and are non-refundable, except as described in our
      <a href="/billing-refund.html">Billing &amp; Refund Policy</a>. You
      authorize us to charge your selected payment method for all applicable
      fees and to suspend or terminate your account for non-payment or
      chargebacks.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Numbering Resources</h2>
    <p>
      Telephone numbers, DID numbers, and related numbering resources assigned
      to you remain the property of TalkUSA or its underlying carriers. You do
      not own the numbers, and your right to use them is conditioned on
      continued compliance with these Terms and timely payment of all fees. We
      may reclaim or reassign numbers as required by law, regulation, or our
      carrier agreements, or if your account is suspended or terminated.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Customer Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Configuring, securing, and maintaining your PBX, endpoints, networks,
        and systems that connect to our Services.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implementing appropriate security controls to protect against
        unauthorized access, toll fraud, and misuse (e.g., strong passwords,
        IP restrictions, rate limits, and monitoring).
      </li>
      <li>
        Ensuring the accuracy of any numbers, routing, and call forwarding
        destinations that you configure in the portal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Informing your end users and obtaining all necessary consents required
        by law prior to calling, texting, or recording communications.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Prohibited Use & Suspension</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, with or without
      notice, if we reasonably believe that you have violated these Terms, our
      Acceptable Use Policy, or applicable law; if your use poses a security or
      fraud risk; or if required by a court order, regulator, or carrier. We
      are not responsible for any losses you may suffer as a result of such
      suspension or termination.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All trademarks, logos, service marks, software, documentation, and other
      intellectual property associated with the Services are owned by TalkUSA
      or its licensors. Except for the limited rights expressly granted in
      these Terms, no license or other rights are granted to you. You agree not
      to copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, or create derivative works
      of the Services or any associated software.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Data Protection & Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Our collection and use of personal data in connection with the Services
      is described in our <a href="/privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. By using
      the Services, you consent to our processing of personal data in
      accordance with that policy. You are responsible for complying with all
      applicable privacy and data protection laws in your use of the Services
      and in your handling of customer and end-user information.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
      ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
      PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY
      IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
      TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE
      ERROR-FREE, UNINTERRUPTED, OR SECURE.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TALKUSA, ITS
      AFFILIATES, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR
      ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE
      DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, OR DATA, ARISING OUT OF OR
      RELATED TO THE SERVICES OR THESE TERMS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF
      THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
    </p>
    <p>
      OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE
      SERVICES OR THESE TERMS WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO

      any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
      reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to: (a) your use of
      the Services; (b) your violation of these Terms or the Acceptable Use
      Policy; or (c) your violation of any law or the rights of any third
      party.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material
      changes, we will post the updated Terms on this page and update the "Last
      updated" date at the top. Your continued use of the Services after the
      effective date of the updated Terms constitutes your acceptance of the
      changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using
      the Services.
    </p>

    <p>
      These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of
      the State of New Mexico, without regard to its conflict of law rules. Any
      dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall
      be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
      located in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, and you consent to the
